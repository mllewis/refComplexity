Exclusions codes used for coding videos:

*load: One of the pictures was on the screen longer than the other due, or not at all, due to loading issues

*click-switch: The child changed their guess because an initial click wasn't registered by the iPad

*listen: The child did not listen until the end of the word before making their selection

*click-through: Repeated clicking on a picture caused the subsequent round to be skipped over without any word being spoken

*hard case: Miscellaneous; for example, when parents were being invasive (this happened once at the museum) or when a child had lots of trouble picking a picture, so experimenter had to tell them that it didn't really matter
